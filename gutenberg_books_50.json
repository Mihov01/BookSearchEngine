The book aims to provide a deeper understanding of Bergson's view on reality, knowledge, and the processes of thought, striving to present a coherent interpretation of his themes and concepts.  The opening of the work sets the stage by introducing Bergson's philosophy and its reception among intellectual circles. Stephen elucidates the common criticism of Bergson as promoting a form of intellectual laziness due to his rejection of rigid logical structures in favor of a more fluid understanding of knowledge. She explains that Bergson’s approach calls for a complete shift in mental habits to grasp the nature of reality and knowledge, proposing that true understanding arises from direct experience rather than abstract concepts and categorizations. This initial portion lays the groundwork for a deeper exploration of how our intellectual biases hinder our understanding of facts as they truly are, as opposed to how we conceptually classify them.
